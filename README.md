## **Image file formats available** ‚úîÔ∏è

- PNG
- JPG
- JPEG
- TIFF
- BMP
- GIF (without animation)

---

## **Extra information** ‚ÑπÔ∏è

- Every picture imported will be saved with a watermark of your election, and the output image will be a png (atleast by now) because it is alternative than GIF or JPG for high colour lossless images and it supports translucency.

- There is no compression added to the final image.

- It will create folders for every image location, if they are on the same folder it will only create one, as this is just one location.
